# cppcube
NxNxN Rubik's Cube Model in C++.

Compile `g++ main.cpp cubes.cpp -o main.exe` and run `./main` to start 
an interactive prompt where you can enter in moves to turn a cube.
Moves are parsed in the form `[depth](Face)[w]['][2]`, `[]` is optional, `()` is mandatory. 
(not exactly standard WCA notation but oh well). For example,
- `F`
- `R U R' U'`
- `R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R'`
- `Rw2 Lw F`
- `3Rw F' L2`
are accepted move sequences. Colours on each face are shown as letters.

Run `visualiser.py` to see a cube net generated by the python implementation of my algorithm. It lags a bit but it's usable .-.
